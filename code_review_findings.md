# Code Review Findings and Required Fixes

## Critical Issues
1. Duplicate Methods
   - AppointmentService.java contains multiple identical `getAppointmentsByDate` method declarations (lines 186, 191, 196)
   - This needs immediate fix to remove duplicates and ensure proper method implementation

2. Security Concerns
   - EmailService.java potentially has hardcoded credentials
   - DatabaseConnection.java might have connection string security issues
   - Password handling in UserService needs review

3. Error Handling
   - Many methods throw SQLException but lack proper exception handling
   - Need to implement proper logging and error recovery

## Improvements Needed
1. Code Organization
   - Main.java contains too many responsibilities
   - Need better separation of concerns
   - Consider implementing proper MVC pattern

2. Input Validation
   - Strengthen input validation in client and appointment services
   - Add proper data sanitization

3. Resource Management
   - Ensure proper connection closing in database operations
   - Implement connection pooling

4. Testing
   - No visible test files
   - Need to add unit tests and integration tests

## Next Steps
1. Fix duplicate methods in AppointmentService
2. Implement proper exception handling
3. Add security improvements
4. Reorganize Main.java into smaller, focused classes
5. Add comprehensive testing suite
